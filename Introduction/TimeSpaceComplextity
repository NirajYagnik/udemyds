Time Complexity

Array
'n' elements, TC= O(n)
If nested-for loops, TC= O(n^2)
2nd case, TC=0(((n^2)-n)/2)
If dividing the list by 2, TC=O(log n)
-------------------------------------------------
Matrix(n*n)
All elements,TC= O(n^2)
-------------------------------------------------
When you're declaring a variable, it is considered for Time Complexity.
if you are intializing it to a particular value then it is considered.
eg 
int a;
NO
eg
a = 3;
YES
Consider every statement as one unit of time.
