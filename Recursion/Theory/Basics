Recursive function has two phases:
1. Calling phase
2. Returning Phase
Recursive Function:
1. Calls itself
2. Base condition + Terminating condition
void fun(int n){
if(n>0){
1.//Executed at calling time
2.fun(n-1);
3.//Executed at returning time
}}
Once the recursive function is called during Calling time, it's activation record is created inside the Stack. Then while returning, the record is deleted.
